# fMRI_Processing_Course
 
Welcome to the fMRI Analysis Course in Python! This repository contains materials for learning how to analyze functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data using Python. The course covers essential concepts in neuroimaging, data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization techniques, utilizing various Python libraries such as NiBabel, Numpy, Scipy, and Nilearn.


### Course Structure
The course is divided into modules, each focusing on different aspects of fMRI analysis:

* Introduction to fMRI and Neuroimaging ==> will be updated 

* Data Acquisition and Preprocessing ==> will be updated 

* Statistical Analysis and GLM  ==> will be updated 

* Functional Connectivity  ==> will be updated 

* Machine Learning in fMRI ==> will be updated 

* Advanced Topics and Future Directions ==> will be updated 

Each module includes lecture notes, Jupyter notebooks with code examples, datasets, and assignments.

Prerequisites
To make the most out of this course, participants should have:

Basic understanding of Python programming.
Basic knowledge of fMRI.
