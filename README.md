# fMRI_Processing_Course
 
Welcome to the fMRI Analysis Course in Python! This repository contains materials for learning how to analyze functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data using Python. The course covers essential concepts in neuroimaging, data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization techniques, utilizing various Python libraries such as NiBabel, Numpy, Scipy, and Nilearn.


### Course Structure
The course is divided into modules, each focusing on different aspects of fMRI analysis:

Introduction to fMRI and Neuroimaging ==> will be updated 

Data Acquisition and Preprocessing ==> will be updated 

Statistical Analysis and GLM

Functional Connectivity

Machine Learning in fMRI

Advanced Topics and Future Directions

Each module includes lecture notes, Jupyter notebooks with code examples, datasets, and assignments.

Prerequisites
To make the most out of this course, participants should have:

Basic understanding of Python programming.
Basic knowledge of fMRI.
